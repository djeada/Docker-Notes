## Security Best Practices

### Image Security
- **Trusted Sources**: Only use images from reputable sources.
- **Regular Scans**: Continuously scan images for vulnerabilities.
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use lean base images to reduce potential threats.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Never embed secrets or credentials within images.

### Container Runtime Security
- **Restricted Privileges**: Run containers as non-root whenever possible.
- **Immutable Containers**: Avoid altering running containers; redeploy with changes.
- **Limit Resources**: Use Docker's resource limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- **System Call Restrictions**: Filter and restrict system calls using seccomp profiles.

### Network Security
- **Isolate Networks**: Use Docker's built-in network policies to control inter-container communication.
- **Encrypted Communications**: Use encrypted networks to ensure data in transit is secure.
- **Limit Exposed Ports**: Expose only necessary ports, reducing the attack surface.

### Host Security
- **Keep Docker Updated**: Regularly update Docker to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Host Isolation**: Ensure a clear boundary between the host and containers.
- **Kernel Protection**: Regularly update the host kernel and be wary of potential exploits since containers share the host kernel.

### Access & Authentication
- **API Security**: Protect Docker APIs with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Secret Management**: Use tools like Docker Secrets or HashiCorpâ€™s Vault to manage sensitive information.
- **User Management**: Implement role-based access control and adhere to the principle of least privilege.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Visibility**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions to oversee container activities.
- **Anomalies Detection**: Monitor for unexpected behaviors indicating potential security threats.

### Infrastructure & Orchestration
- **Orchestration Security**: If using orchestrators like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, follow their respective best practices.
- **Read-Only Filesystems**: When possible, run containers with filesystems in read-only mode to prevent unwanted modifications.
